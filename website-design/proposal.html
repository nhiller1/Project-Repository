<h1><u>Project Proposal</u></h1>
   <h2>Introduction to Project:</h2> 
   For this project, I am planning on creating a website for a potential business venture. 
   Currently, my family has an aerospace manufacturing branch in Poland, called Admill 
   Spolka z.o.o.  As they seek work in the U.S., I am looking to create a website for 
   NB Aero, which would primarily be a marketing company for this business.  
  
  <h2>Objectives:</h2>
    The objective of my website will be to showcase the services that NB Aero provides as a liason between Admill Spolka z.o.o and the U.S. customers.  It will also showcase the capabilities and facilities of Admill Spolka z.o.o.
  
   <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
   My target audience is primarily larger, U.S. based aerospace manufacturing companies, who would be looking to outsource different aerospace manufacturing jobs. 

   <h2>Content:</h2>
    As it is NB Aero's job will be to serve more as a "middle man," the content will consist of 
    a lot of descriptions of what services we provide.  In addition to having a Home page and a 
    "Contact Us" page, I am planning on having a page that introduces Admill Spolka z.o.o, to provide the customer with more information about the company they would be hiring through us. There will be a page for the different types services, that will link to separate pages that will go into depth about each one, such as quoting and procurement.  I will also have a page for logistics, talking about the shipping and receiving aspect of the business. Lastly, I will want to include a gallery showing the different facilities and work that Admill Spolka z does.
